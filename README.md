El laberinto del tesoro

Project Description
El laberinto del tesoro is a horror game where the player explores a maze, avoiding a lurking monster while searching for a hidden treasure chest. The player can use statues inside the maze as guides and must manage a flashlight and a radio to evade the monster. If the monster approaches, turning off the flashlight is crucial to avoid being attacked. The radio helps indicate the proximity to the treasure chest by distorting more as the player moves farther away from it. However, if the monster is nearby and the radio is on, the player runs the risk of being attacked.

Technologies Used
C++: The core logic of the game.
OpenGL: For graphics and rendering.
Visual Studio: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for development.

Challenges Faced
One of the significant challenges during development was managing textures. Sometimes, when loading models, they would mistakenly take on the texture of another model rather than their own.

Future Features
Due to the academic nature of the project, no updates are planned. However, some future improvements were considered, they would include:
Adding new maps.
Implementing a map/level selector.

Installation and Running Instructions
To install and run the project locally, follow these steps:
Download and install Visual Studio IDE.
Configure the environment with the necessary libraries.
Clone the repository from GitHub.
Perform the necessary CMake checks.
Execute the main.cpp file.

Usage Instructions
El laberinto del tesoro is a horror walking simulator. The controls are as follows:
Movement: Use WASD keys.
View Control: Use the mouse.
Flashlight: Left click to toggle on/off.
Radio: Right click to toggle on/off.
